Write-up
---------<DONE>-----------
[Issue (SOLVED)] mousechecks not working on sub node GUI elements. mousechecks is being called but not returning correct result. possibly due to screen coords being used for the x and y of the sub node elements
Add default values for plugs based on their dimensions [Done]
Rewrite mouse checks to implement layey checking and so that a simple hover(),
released()or pressed()is sent to the GUI element and the specifics are handled GUI side [Done]
Canvas to Screen for GUI node elements
ADD FUNCTIONALITYY OF LIMITING CHARACTER INPUT ON TEXT INPUT BOXES Also maybe redo alot the entire things.
UI elements and inputs should simply be structured like a list and output should be on the right.
Simplify sub node elements so that height and width of the node is calculated by the size of the elements inside it
Make it so when drawing from a output node you can only finish on an input node and vice versa 
When nodes are selected they get moved to the top layer. (By doing this it stops the multiple node dragging)
Improve plugs so that connections can be broken
Reverse mouse check loop so it searches backwards in order to allow selection of toplayer. (The search loops have been reversed but making the loop stop calling pressed() is looking to be complicated)
Find a way to delete nodes
Nodes that are not within the canvas view are not drawn
Use a cut off mask for the canvas
Canvas movements 
New nodes are placed in the center of the canvas view. Not at [0, 0]
Connections are not deleted when nodes are
Multiple textInputs can be active at the same time
Nodes are being created odd sizes when being made at high zooms (Weirdly it's only the first node being created within that update. For some reason the rest are normal)
Fix line overflow on text Input
Add textwrap to label
Implement conditioning for connections
Encrypt and Decrypt toggle
draw Nodes on top of connections
Copy and paste
Changed bezier formula
Layout final UI
Char to value node
